I'm writing software since I am 15 years old.
Having started with Visual Basic and later learning Delphi, C++, Perl, I'm using Java, JavaScript and Python on a professional level.
I'm passionate about good software design and clean code.

### By day

In my day job, I work as Senior Staff Software Engineer at [BlueYonder](https://blueyonder.com/) in Hamburg. I lead a team of Software Engineers and Data Scientists. They build services that help companies to
make better decisions in their whole supply chain.

### By night

In my spare time, I like to contribute to Open Source projects and learn new things.
Through the [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), I came to [Python](https://www.python.org/). Man, I love this language and the community.


For the community, I like to attend Python conferences like [PyConDE](https://de.pycon.org/) and [EuroPython]({filename}/development/europython2019.md).
I try to give something back by volunteering and giving talks.

Also, I'm a mentor at [Jugend hackt](https://jugendhackt.org/event-rueckblick/heidelberg-2019/) (see my lightning talk [here](https://media.ccc.de/v/jh19-hd-1002-clean_code)).
