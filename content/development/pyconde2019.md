This year, I attended PyConDE for the seconds time. Having PyConDE 2017 been my first open source conference
I was really looking forward to it.

## Talks
I attended some talks. For some, I used the description of the talk, for others I summarized in addition what I learned

#### Carla Hustedt - Algo.Rules - How do we get the ethics into the code?
Description of the talk:

> Algorithms are increasingly relied upon in decision making processes that can have far-reaching implications for all of us. 
> They help doctors diagnose diseases and develop treatment plans. They tell police officers where to patrol. 
> They decide who is going to be invited to the job interview. 
>
> It is up to us to ensure that algorithmic systems are designed for the benefit of society. 
> But how do we make sure that the individual and collective freedoms and rights that comprise human rights are strengthened, 
> not undermined, by the use of algorithmic systems? In the keynote I address the complex interconnections between the technology and society, highlighting potential solutions to understanding, building and regulating algorithm decision making.

#### Ingo Stegmaier - Developers vs. Enterprise

Description of the talk
> This 30-minute talk will give you an overview about project management, success factors and specialties within enterprises. 
>This will be a guide how you promote internal projects and bring them to success within a highly "political" environment.
> 
> Often developers feel misunderstood while managers are overwhelmed with technical details. 
>In this talk I'll present how both world can get a better understanding with each other to collaborate better - and without the pains.

I really enjoyed Ingo's talk and also a small chat with him afterwards. The emphasis an stakeholder management and to have
a common language is very important. One point I like to add from my experience is, sometimes it's with building a 
prototype. One might not get management's buy-in for a vague idea or research project. I built a lot of tools after work
and on the weekends which emerged into widely used (1000+ users) tools. 

It's like in the quote of [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper):
> It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission
